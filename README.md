#### <b><i>PROJECT 1 ;</b></i>
<ul>
  <li><em>Find Hypotenuse Angle</em></li>
 </ul>

When the user enters the site, first of all, he will learn what the hypotenuse angle is, and then he/she will learn that the hypotenuse angle is found with Pythagorean Theorem. And in the calculation section written with html, css and Javascript codes, it finds the hypotenuse angle by typing the two edge angles and pressing the calculate button. 

#### <b><em>PROJECT 2 ;</b></em>
<ul>
  <li><em>Find Day</em></li>
 </ul>
 
The purpose of this project is that when users press the button, this Program tells them what day it is that day. This can condition with the Switch-Case. First we need to write Html codes. After that, we need to write Css and JavaScript codes. The Switch-Case is very important for this program. We write in Javascript. We say a case on the Switch and then we write the Case's. With the *`break;`* experience, we should say out of the Case when the right condition is found.

#### <b><em>PROJECT 3 ;</b></em>
<ul>
  <li><em>Exam-Result</em></li>
 </ul>
 
In this project, Users enter the midterm result and final result. Then by clicking the button, they will see the pass or fail status. We query this through if-else structure in JavaScript.
